abstract = {Modern malware increasingly exploits information hiding to remain undetected while attacking. To this aim, network covert channels, i.e., hidden communication paths established within legitimate flows, can be used to exfiltrate data or exchange commands without getting noticed by firewalls, antivirus, and intrusion detection systems. Since the secret data can be directly injected in various portions of the stream or encoded via suitable alterations of the traffic, spotting hidden communications is a challenging and poorly generalizable task. Moreover, the majority of works addressed IPv4, thus leaving the detection of covert channels targeting IPv6 almost unexplored. This paper presents bccstego, i.e., an inspection framework for computing statistical indicators to reveal covert channels targeting the IPv6 header. The proposed approach has been designed to be easily extended, for instance to search for channels not known a priori. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our first tool in the bccstego framework as well as its ability to handle high-throughput IPv6 flows without adding additional delays.},

abstract = {The increasing diffusion of malware endowed with steganographic and cloaking capabilities requires tools and techniques for conducting research activities, testing real deployments and elaborating mitigation mechanisms. To investigate attacks targeting network and appliances, a core requirement concerns the availability of suitable traffic traces, which can be used to derive mathematical models for simulation or to develop machine-learning-based countermeasures. Unfortunately, the young nature of threats injecting secrets or cloaking their presence within network traffic, the high protocol-dependent nature of the various embedding processes, and privacy issues, prevent the vast diffusion of datasets to perform research. Therefore, in this paper we present pcapStego, a tool for creating network covert channels within .pcap files. This approach has two major advantages: it allows to prepare large datasets starting from real network traces, and it generates “replayable” conversations useful for both emulating attacks or conduct pentesting campaigns. To prove the effectiveness of the tool, we showcase the generation of network covert channels targeting IPv6 traffic, which is gaining momentum and it is expected to be a major target for future attacks.},

abstract = {Modern malware increasingly takes advantage of information hiding to avoid detection, spread infections, and obfuscate code. A major offensive strategy exploits steganography to conceal scripts or URLs, which can be used to steal credentials or retrieve additional payloads. A recent example is the attack campaign against the Magento e-commerce platform, where a web skimmer has been cloaked in favicons to steal payment information of users. In this paper, we propose an approach based on deep learning for detecting threats using least significant bit steganography to conceal malicious PHP scripts and URLs in favicons. Experimental results, conducted on a realistic dataset with both legitimate and compromised images, demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution. Specifically, our model detects ∼ 100\% of the compromised favicons when examples of various malicious payloads are provided in the learning phase. Instead, it achieves an overall accuracy of ∼ 90\% when in the presence of new payloads or alternative encoding schemes.},

abstract = {An increasing trend exploits steganography to conceal payloads in digital images, e.g., to drop malicious executables or to retrieve configuration files. Due to the very attack-specific nature of the exploited hiding mechanisms, developing general detection methods is a hard task. An effective approach concerns the creation of ad-hoc solutions to be integrated within general toolkits, also to holistically face unknown threats. Therefore, this paper discusses the integration of a tool for detecting malicious contents hidden in digital images via the Invoke-PSImage technique within the Secure Intelligent Methods for Advanced Recognition of Malware and Stegomalware framework. Since the real impact of images embedding steganographic threats and the behavior of ad-hoc solutions in realistic scenarios are still unknown territories, this work also showcases a performance evaluation conducted in a nation-wide telecommunication provider. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach and also support the need of modular architectures to face the emerging wave of highly-specialized threats.},
