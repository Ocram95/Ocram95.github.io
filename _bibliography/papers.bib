  abstract = {Modern malware is becoming hard to spot since attackers are increasingly adopting new techniques to elude signature- and rule-based detection mechanisms. Among the others, steganography and information hiding can be used to bypass security frameworks searching for suspicious communications between processes or exfiltration attempts through covert channels. Since the array of potential carriers is very large (e.g., information can be hidden in hardware resources, various multimedia files or network flows), detecting this class of threats is a scarcely generalizable process and gathering multiple behavioral information is time-consuming, lacks scalability, and could lead to performance degradation.
  In this paper, we leverage the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), which is a recent code augmentation feature provided by the Linux kernel, for programmatically tracing and monitoring the behavior of software processes in a very efficient way. To prove the flexibility of the approach, we investigate two realistic use cases implementing different attack mechanisms, i.e., two processes colluding via the alteration of the file system and hidden network communication attempts nested within IPv6 traffic flows. Our results show that even simple eBPF programs can provide useful data for the detection of anomalies, with a minimal overhead. Furthermore, the flexibility to develop and run such programs allows to extract relevant features that could be used for the creation of datasets for feeding security frameworks exploiting AI.}

Moreover, since the detection of steganographic threats is poorly generalizable, being able to collect attack-independent indicators is of prime importance.

abstract = {Modern malware increasingly exploits information hiding to remain undetected while attacking. To this aim, network covert channels, i.e., hidden communication paths established within legitimate flows, can be used to exfiltrate data or exchange commands without getting noticed by firewalls, antivirus, and intrusion detection systems. Since the secret data can be directly injected in various portions of the stream or encoded via suitable alterations of the traffic, spotting hidden communications is a challenging and poorly generalizable task. Moreover, the majority of works addressed IPv4, thus leaving the detection of covert channels targeting IPv6 almost unexplored. This paper presents bccstego, i.e., an inspection framework for computing statistical indicators to reveal covert channels targeting the IPv6 header. The proposed approach has been designed to be easily extended, for instance to search for channels not known a priori. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our first tool in the bccstego framework as well as its ability to handle high-throughput IPv6 flows without adding additional delays.},

To this aim, a key approach exploits network covert channels, i.e., abusive communication paths nested within a legitimate traffic flow. The increasing diffusion of IPv6 makes it attractive for an attacker, especially for the presence of the Flow Label field, which can be manipulated to contain up to 20 secret bits per packet. Unfortunately, gathering data to implement a standalone detection mechanism or to support third-party security tools is a poorly generalizable process and often leads to scalability issues. This paper showcases how to take advantage of code augmentation features (i.e., the extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to detect covert channels targeting the IPv6 Flow Label. To prove its effectiveness, the proposed approach has been tested against Internet-wide traffic traces collected in the wild. Results indicate that it is possible to spot the channel while mitigating the memory footprint and the computational burden (e.g., the processed traffic only experience an additional delay of a few nanoseconds).}

To investigate attacks targeting network and appliances, a core requirement concerns the availability of suitable traffic traces, which can be used to derive mathematical models for simulation or to develop machine-learning-based countermeasures. Unfortunately, the young nature of threats injecting secrets or cloaking their presence within network traffic, the high protocol-dependent nature of the various embedding processes, and privacy issues, prevent the vast diffusion of datasets to perform research. Therefore, in this paper we present pcapStego, a tool for creating network covert channels within .pcap files. This approach has two major advantages: it allows to prepare large datasets starting from real network traces, and it generates “replayable” conversations useful for both emulating attacks or conduct pentesting campaigns. To prove the effectiveness of the tool, we showcase the generation of network covert channels targeting IPv6 traffic, which is gaining momentum and it is expected to be a major target for future attacks.},

Among the various approaches observed in real attacks, a popular one exploits embedding malicious information within innocent-looking pictures. In this paper, we present a machine learning technique for sanitizing images containing malicious data injected via the Invoke-PSImage method. Specifically, we propose to use a deep neural network realized through a residual convolutional autoencoder to disrupt the malicious information hidden within an image without altering its visual quality. The experimental evaluation proves the effectiveness of our approach on a dataset of images injected with PowerShell scripts. Our tool removes the injected artifacts and inhibits the reconstruction of the scripts, partially recovering the initial image quality.}

A recent example is the attack campaign against the Magento e-commerce platform, where a web skimmer has been cloaked in favicons to steal payment information of users. In this paper, we propose an approach based on deep learning for detecting threats using least significant bit steganography to conceal malicious PHP scripts and URLs in favicons. Experimental results, conducted on a realistic dataset with both legitimate and compromised images, demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution. Specifically, our model detects ∼ 100\% of the compromised favicons when examples of various malicious payloads are provided in the learning phase. Instead, it achieves an overall accuracy of ∼ 90\% when in the presence of new payloads or alternative encoding schemes.},

In this paper we investigate security impacts of covert communications based on the looser isolation of memory statistics information. Our characterization indicates that the investigation of system calls should be considered a prime tool to reveal the presence of collusive attack schemes.

  abstract = {The exponential growth in the number of cyber threats requires sharing in a timely and efficient manner a wide range of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), ie, fragments of forensics data that can be used to recognize malicious network or system activities. To this aim, a suitable architecture is required, especially to distribute and process the various IoCs. Unfortunately, the continuous creation of offensive techniques, along with the diffusion of advanced persistent threats, imposes the ability to update and extend the platform used to manage the multitude of IoCs collected in the wild. In this paper, we present the ORISHA architecture, which takes advantage of a distributed threat detection system to match performance and scalability requirements. The paper also discusses how the platform can be extended to handle the most recent “stealthy” malware as well as campaigns aimed at spreading fake news.}

abstract = {An increasing trend exploits steganography to conceal payloads in digital images, e.g., to drop malicious executables or to retrieve configuration files. Due to the very attack-specific nature of the exploited hiding mechanisms, developing general detection methods is a hard task. An effective approach concerns the creation of ad-hoc solutions to be integrated within general toolkits, also to holistically face unknown threats. Therefore, this paper discusses the integration of a tool for detecting malicious contents hidden in digital images via the Invoke-PSImage technique within the Secure Intelligent Methods for Advanced Recognition of Malware and Stegomalware framework. Since the real impact of images embedding steganographic threats and the behavior of ad-hoc solutions in realistic scenarios are still unknown territories, this work also showcases a performance evaluation conducted in a nation-wide telecommunication provider. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach and also support the need of modular architectures to face the emerging wave of highly-specialized threats.},
